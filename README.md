# Hi there, I'm Ada Elechi! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Front-End Developer** passionate about building interactive and engaging web experiences. My toolkit includes:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**

I'm always learning and exploring new ways to create beautiful and functional websites. While I'm just getting started with open source and personal projects here, I'm excited to grow my portfolio and collaborate with other developers!
